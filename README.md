# BSQ
find the biggest square in c

# Prerequisites
* cmake
* gcc

Type make on the root directory of the project
# Playing the game
To launch the game use: ``./bsq [File]``
* **``File``**: ``.`` represent free space, ``o`` represent obstacles
# Coding style
The code follows a particular coding style enforced by my school. The most important aspects are:
* No more than 5 functions in a ``*.c`` file.
* No more than 3 levels of branching.
* No more than 1 ``else if`` in a branching chain.
* No typedefs in ``*.c`` files.
* No structure arguments passed by value (always use a pointer).
* Functions must not exceed 20 lines.
* Variable declarations must always be done at the top of the function scope.
* The only empty line in functions is the one separating variable declarations with the rest of the function's body.
* Source files must start with some header containing the project name and file description.

This code follows completely the C Epitech Coding style
